bind                    Dummy object used for generic function
                        dispatching.
case_func               Creates a pattern matching function.
cases                   Dispatches from an expression to a matching
                        pattern
cases_expr_             Create an expression that tests patterns
                        against an expression in turn
construction_printer    Print a constructed value
copy_env                Move the bound variables from one environment
                        into another.
deparse_construction    Create a string representation from a
                        constructed object
make_match_expr         Create an if-statement for 'cases_expr' and
                        'cases_expr_' functions
process_alternatives    Goes through a list of |-separated expressions
                        and define them as constructors
process_arg             Build a tibble form a list of constructor
                        arguments.
process_arguments       Construct a tibble from all the arguments of a
                        constructor
process_constructor     Create a constructor and put it in an
                        environment.
process_constructor_constant
                        Create a constant constructor and put it in an
                        environment.
process_constructor_function
                        Create a function constructor and put it in an
                        environment.
test_pattern_           Test if a pattern matches an expression
test_pattern_rec        Recursive comparison of expression and pattern.
transform_cases_call    Recursive function for transforming a call
                        'cases'.
transform_cases_function
                        Transform a function containing a 'cases' call
                        into one that instead has if-statements.
